Vis-NIR spectroscopic assessment of soil aggregate stability and aggregate size distribution in the Belgian Loam Belt.

We explored the possibility of using laboratory Visible-Near infrared (Vis-NIR) spectroscopy to predict aggregate 
mean weight diameter (MWD), and three aggregate size fractions (i.e. clay+silt, microaggregate (63–250μm) and 
macroaggregate (>250μm)) resulting from wet-sieving. Two spectra-based approaches, one (SPF approach) that built 
direct linkage between soil spectra and four AS indexes via partial least squares regression and the other 
(SPF+PTF approach) that established pedotransfer functions based on spectroscopically predicted elementary soil 
properties, were developed on a total of 83 topsoil samples collected in the Belgian Loam Belt. The data, 
including laboratory measurements of soil properties and soil spectral data, provided here will allow the 
analyses described above. (2020-06-04)
