Influence of soil sample preparation on the quantification of NPK content through spectroscopy.

The dataset is comprised by four MS Excel files, two for the clayey soil and two for sandy soil used 
in the study, according the spectroscopy technique used (Diffuse Reflectance on Visible and Near 
Infrared region and Attenuated Total Reflectance on Mid Infrared region). Each file is divided 
in six tabs, according the soil preparation procedure used in the study (sieved mesch and dry 
temperature). Each tab contains the total N content and P and K availability measured by 
wet-chemical analysis, related to the full spectra.
