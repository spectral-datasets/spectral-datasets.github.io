A high-throughput FTIR spectroscopy approach to assess adaptive variation in the chemical composition of pollen

The two factors defining male reproductive success in plants are pollen quantity and quality, but our knowledge 
about the importance of pollen quality is limited due to methodological constraints. Pollen quality in terms of 
chemical composition may be either genetically fixed for high performance independent of environmental conditions, 
or it may be plastic to maximize reproductive output under different environmental conditions. In this study, 
we validated a new approach for studying the role of chemical composition of pollen in adaptation to local climate. 
The approach is based on high-throughput Fourier infrared (FTIR) characterization and biochemical interpretation 
of pollen chemical composition in response to environmental conditions. The study covered three grass species, 
Poa alpina, Anthoxanthum odoratum, and Festuca ovina. For each species, plants were grown from seeds of three 
populations with wide geographic and climate variation. Each individual plant was divided into four genetically 
identical clones which were grown in different controlled environments (high and low levels of temperature and 
nutrients). In total, 389 samples were measured using a high-throughput FTIR spectrometer. The biochemical 
fingerprints of pollen were species and population specific, and plastic in response to different 
environmental conditions. The response was most pronounced for temperature, influencing the levels of 
proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates in pollen of all species. Furthermore, there is considerable variation 
in plasticity of the chemical composition of pollen among species and populations. The use of high-throughput 
FTIR spectroscopy provides fast, cheap, and simple assessment of the chemical composition of pollen. In 
combination with controlled-condition growth experiments and multivariate analyses, FTIR spectroscopy 
opens up for studies of the adaptive role of pollen that until now has been difficult with available 
methodology. The approach can easily be extended to other species and environmental conditions and has the 
potential to significantly increase our understanding of plant male function.
