Diffuse reflectance near infrared spectroscopy and Soil engineering properties data.

This study aimed to assess performance of NIR-PLS for rapid estimation of several 
soil properties that are commonly used in materials indices for civil engineering 
applications using an independent validation data set drawn from the same 
geographical area. (2014-12-08)
