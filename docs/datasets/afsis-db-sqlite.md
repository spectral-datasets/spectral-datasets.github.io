A Globally Distributed Soil Spectral Library: Visible Near Infrared Diffuse Reflectance Spectra.

The need to maintain the health of the soil resource base as an imperative for sustainable development 
is increasingly being recognized. Science and technological developments in remote sensing are providing 
new opportunities for low cost and efficient applications for characterizing and monitoring the health 
of the soil resource base. We are pleased to introduce this spectral library of world soils, which will 
provide a valuable resource for research and applications for sensing soil quality both in the laboratory 
and from space. This product is a result of collaboration between ICRAF and ISRIC scientists and we 
encourage further development of this area of research.
