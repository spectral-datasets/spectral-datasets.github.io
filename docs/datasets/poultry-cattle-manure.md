The dataset consists of 332 manure samples from poultry and cattle origin, sampled in farms located in 
major regions of livestock production in mainland France and Reunion Island. The samples were analysed 
for seven chemical properties following conventional laboratory methods : dry matter (DM), total 
ammonium nitrogen (NH4), total nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P2O5), calcium (CaO), magnesium (MgO) and 
potassium (K2O). Near-Infrared (NIR) spectra were acquired with three spectrometers on fresh homogenized 
and dried ground samples and standardized by PDS algorithm. (2020-08-31)
