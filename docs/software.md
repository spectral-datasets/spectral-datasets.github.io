For converting datasets, we typically use our [ADAMS](https://adams.cms.waikato.ac.nz/) framework, the 
*adams-spectral-app* version to be more precise. You can download it from here:

* [Daily build](https://adams.cms.waikato.ac.nz/download/snapshot/)
* [Release](https://adams.cms.waikato.ac.nz/download/release/)

ADAMS is a Java-based application, all you need is Java 11+ on your computer in order to run it. 

In order to set it up, there is no need to have administrative rights. See the following
