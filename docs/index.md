Welcome to the *Spectral datasets* website, maintained by the [Applied Machine Learning group](https://www.data-mining.co.nz/)
at the [University of Waikato](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/), NZ. On this website, we have collected
publicly available [NIRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-infrared_spectroscopy) datasets, making not only
the original data available, but also various conversions.
