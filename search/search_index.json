The need to maintain the health of the soil resource base as an imperative for sustainable development is increasingly being recognized. Science and technological developments in remote sensing are providing new opportunities for low cost and efficient applications for characterizing and monitoring the health of the soil resource base. We are pleased to introduce this spectral library of world soils, which will provide a valuable resource for research and applications for sensing soil quality both in the laboratory and from space. This product is a result of collaboration between ICRAF and ISRIC scientists and we encourage further development of this area of research.

Pollen quality in terms of chemical composition may be either genetically fixed for high performance independent of environmental conditions, or it may be plastic to maximize reproductive output under different environmental conditions. In this study, we validated a new approach for studying the role of chemical composition of pollen in adaptation to local climate. The approach is based on high-throughput Fourier infrared (FTIR) characterization and biochemical interpretation of pollen chemical composition in response to environmental conditions. The study covered three grass species, Poa alpina, Anthoxanthum odoratum, and Festuca ovina. For each species, plants were grown from seeds of three populations with wide geographic and climate variation. Each individual plant was divided into four genetically identical clones which were grown in different controlled environments (high and low levels of temperature and nutrients). In total, 389 samples were measured using a high-throughput FTIR spectrometer. The biochemical fingerprints of pollen were species and population specific, and plastic in response to different environmental conditions. The response was most pronounced for temperature, influencing the levels of proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates in pollen of all species. Furthermore, there is considerable variation in plasticity of the chemical composition of pollen among species and populations. The use of high-throughput FTIR spectroscopy provides fast, cheap, and simple assessment of the chemical composition of pollen. In combination with controlled-condition growth experiments and multivariate analyses, FTIR spectroscopy opens up for studies of the adaptive role of pollen that until now has been difficult with available methodology. The approach can easily be extended to other species and environmental conditions and has the potential to significantly increase our understanding of plant male function.

We explored the possibility of using laboratory Visible-Near infrared (Vis-NIR) spectroscopy to predict aggregate mean weight diameter (MWD), and three aggregate size fractions (i.e. clay+silt, microaggregate (63\u2013250\u03bcm) and macroaggregate (>250\u03bcm)) resulting from wet-sieving. Two spectra-based approaches, one (SPF approach) that built direct linkage between soil spectra and four AS indexes via partial least squares regression and the other (SPF+PTF approach) that established pedotransfer functions based on spectroscopically predicted elementary soil properties, were developed on a total of 83 topsoil samples collected in the Belgian Loam Belt. The data, including laboratory measurements of soil properties and soil spectral data, provided here will allow the analyses described above.
