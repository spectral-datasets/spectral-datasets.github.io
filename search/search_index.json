The need to maintain the health of the soil resource base as an imperative for sustainable development is increasingly being recognized. Science and technological developments in remote sensing are providing new opportunities for low cost and efficient applications for characterizing and monitoring the health of the soil resource base. We are pleased to introduce this spectral library of world soils, which will provide a valuable resource for research and applications for sensing soil quality both in the laboratory and from space. This product is a result of collaboration between ICRAF and ISRIC scientists and we encourage further development of this area of research.

Pollen quality in terms of chemical composition may be either genetically fixed for high performance independent of environmental conditions, or it may be plastic to maximize reproductive output under different environmental conditions. In this study, we validated a new approach for studying the role of chemical composition of pollen in adaptation to local climate. The approach is based on high-throughput Fourier infrared (FTIR) characterization and biochemical interpretation of pollen chemical composition in response to environmental conditions. The study covered three grass species, Poa alpina, Anthoxanthum odoratum, and Festuca ovina. For each species, plants were grown from seeds of three populations with wide geographic and climate variation. Each individual plant was divided into four genetically identical clones which were grown in different controlled environments (high and low levels of temperature and nutrients). In total, 389 samples were measured using a high-throughput FTIR spectrometer. The biochemical fingerprints of pollen were species and population specific, and plastic in response to different environmental conditions. The response was most pronounced for temperature, influencing the levels of proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates in pollen of all species. Furthermore, there is considerable variation in plasticity of the chemical composition of pollen among species and populations. The use of high-throughput FTIR spectroscopy provides fast, cheap, and simple assessment of the chemical composition of pollen. In combination with controlled-condition growth experiments and multivariate analyses, FTIR spectroscopy opens up for studies of the adaptive role of pollen that until now has been difficult with available methodology. The approach can easily be extended to other species and environmental conditions and has the potential to significantly increase our understanding of plant male function.

The Africa Soil Information Service (AfSIS), was a project led by the Tropical Soil Biology and Fertility Institute (TSBF) of the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT), based in Nairobi, in collaboration with several partners including the World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF). The AfSIS projectf aimed to narrow sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s (SSA) soil information gap and provide a consistent baseline for monitoring soil ecosystem services. Sentinel sites were established and top- and subsoil samples were collected from each subplot at 0-20 cm and 20-50 cm depth increments, respectively, and pooled (composited) into one sample for each plot and depth, resulting in a total of 320 standard soil samples per sentinel site (V\u00e5gen et al., 2010). These samples were analyzed using near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy. NIR spectral measurements were conducted through regional laboratories in eastern, southern and West Africa (V\u00e5gen et al., 2010). The NIR spectral laboratory network used standard instrumentation and standard operating procedures to ensure reproducibility of results among laboratories and over time (V\u00e5gen et al., 2010). The ICRAF laboratory provided technical backstopping and quality control for the network of NIR spectral laboratories. This is the complete dataset of the NIR spectra matched with the Sentinel Site sample details for all seven AfSIS sentinel sites sampled and analyzed in Tanzania in 2010.
